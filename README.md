# Nonparametric_Project
Project for the course Nonparametric statistics

The objective is to give an overall interpretation of the decreasing in the fertility rates in Italy in the last 20 years, addressing the differences in space (*data are divided by province*) and in the class of ages of the mothers, trying to capture an overall variability in these different factors.

## Introductive analysis
As an introductive analysis we have shrinked the 3D domain in 2D domains integrating out a variable at a time.
1. **Intro A**: Integrating out the class of ages for the mothers, an analysis on the total newborns divided by province.
2. **Intro B**: Integrating out the space, an analysis on how the rates for ages have changed in the last 20 years.
3. **Intro C**: Integrating out the time, an analysis of how the rates for ages changes nowadays in the various Italy's provinces.

## Mathematical framework
The mathematical framework is the functional data analysis, where each curve is treated as a function of a precise space. We use nonparametric approaches to deal with such data and to perform inference tests.

## Inference
Differences in both the years and geographic regions are analyzed through several permutation tests, and results are interpreted for the data, their first and second derivatives.

## Non-parametric regression
A non-parametric approach for regression is used for finding factors and possible variables in order to explain the data.

## Conformal prediction
This technique is used to validate the model proposed in the previous section.
