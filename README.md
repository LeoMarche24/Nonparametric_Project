# Nonparametric_Project
Project for the course Nonparametric statistics

The objective is to give an overall interpretation to the fertility rates in Italy in the last 20 years, addressing the differences in space (*data are divided by province*) and in the class of ages of the mothers.

## Analisi introduttiva
As an introductive analysis we have shrinked the 3D domain in 2D domains integrating out a variable at a time.
1. **Intro A**: Integrating out the class of ages for the mothers, an analysis on the total newborns divided by province.
2. **Intro B**: Integrating out the space, an analysis on how the rates for ages have changed in the last 20 years.
3. **Intro C**: Integrating out the time, an analysis of how the rates for ages changes nowadays in the various Italy's provinces.
